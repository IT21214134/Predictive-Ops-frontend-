# “PredictiveOps”: Advanced Predictive Maintenance System for Industrial Machinery

Predictive Maintenance (PdM) systems are essential in today’s industrial settings, as they help to minimize unexpected equipment failures, improve maintenance efficiency, and prolong the life of machinery. The system begins with data acquisition and preprocessing, collecting real-time data from various sensors attached to the machinery, including vibration, temperature, and current sensors. This raw data is parsed and cleaned to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring high-quality inputs for further analysis. Historical sensor data, along with maintenance records, are used to train machine learning models designed to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of potential equipment failures. Techniques such as anomaly detection and severity assessment evaluate the real-time data against these models.
